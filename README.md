# Honeypot-Setup-and-Installation

## Objective
Detect unauthorized activity or learn more about an attacker and their motives. This project sets up a honeypot to enchance cybersecurity by providing threat detection and analysis of malicious activities in a controlled environment. It allows for vulnerability assessment by revealing weaknesses in network security, while also serving as a research tool to study malware and attack techniques. Additionally, the honeypot acts as a distraction for attackers, diverting them from critical assets and improving incident response times.
